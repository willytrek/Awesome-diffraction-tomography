## Background, Theory, and Survey
### Background and Theory
- - [Introduction to Fourier Optics](https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Introduction_to_Fourier_Optics.html?id=QllRAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y) by Joseph W. Goodman is a great book to learn the basics of wave propagation.


### Survey Papers
- - [The Theory of Diffraction Tomography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00466) 
## Optical diffraction tomography (ODT)
