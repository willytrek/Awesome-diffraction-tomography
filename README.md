# Awesome-diffraction-tomography

A curated list of resources on diffraction tomography.

## Disclaimer

This list is compiled during our paper survey about diffraction tomography and is not meant to be exhaustive. The list is organized so that we can easily navigate different topics in diffraction tomography.
Thank Brian Chao's template.
